Problem Statement:
-----------------

      There are series of transactions stored in a file. We need to compute the average time of the transactions.
      Example of transactions:
            T1234, 2020 - 03 - 01 , 3:15 am, start
            T1235, 2020 - 03 - 01 , 3:16 pm, start
            T1236, 2020 - 03 - 01 , 3:17 pm, start
            T1234, 2020 - 03 - 01 , 3:18 pm, End
            T1235, 2020 - 03 - 01 , 3:18 pm, End

To run:

      Clone the repo. Move to the Source Folder(cd TechMojo)
      **python src/Run.py** in the terminal
      
      To test:
      **python test/TestRun.py**
```
